# Q-Fuse-Lightweight-Sensor-Fusion-Engine-for-Embedded-Systems
Q-Fuse is a lightweight sensor fusion engine written in C. It fuses data from an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to compute orientation (roll, pitch, yaw). Designed for real-time embedded systems, it avoids dynamic memory and uses fixed-point-friendly math.
